7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody

8. rot13

Write a function that encodes a string using rot13.


9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper

Write a function that prints an integer.
10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work

Add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.

	12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls

	Write a function that prints a buffer.

	Prototype: void print_buffer(char *b, int size);
	The function must print the content of size bytes of the buffer pointed by b
	The output should print 10 bytes per line
	Each line starts with the position of the first byte of the line in hexadecimal (8 chars), starting with 0
	Each line shows the hexadecimal content (2 chars) of the buffer, 2 bytes at a time, separated by a space
	Each line shows the content of the buffer. If the byte is a printable character, print the letter, if not, print .
	Each line ends with a new line \n
	If size is 0 or less, the output should be a new line only \n
	You are allowed to use the standard library
	The output should look like the following example, and formatted exactly the same way
